# HQ-Hotels
Joining Hotels by different suppliers

As an Online Travel Agency, HQ has to handle working with different suppliers of rooms. Different suppliers might provide the same room or room type from a given hotel. In order to aggregate offers for a same (room, hotel), we need to be able to find / maintain a mapping between hotels from different suppliers (ex: hotel 43 from supplier1 is the same to hotel 1007 from supplier 2). This pairing process have to be automated (too many hotels) and maintained by a data engineer. So working on this process will be an important aspect of this position.
